### Upstream configuration for Varnish functioning has a cache.

## Add as many servers as needed.
## Cf. http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpUpstreamModule.
## Note that this configuration assumes by default that keepalive
## upstream connections are supported and that you have a Nginx
## version with the fair load balancer.

    ## Use the least connection algorithm for load balancing. This
    ## algorithm was introduced in versions 1.3.1 and 1.2.2.
